// Theory

// Async Code

// javascript -> synchronous and Single Threaded Language

// Execution Context -> execute one line of code at a time

// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

// Blocking Code Vs Non Blocking Code

// Blocking code -> Block the flow of Program -> Read File Sync

// Non Blocking code -> Does not Block execution -> Read File Async

// js Engine made with -> memory heap And CallStack


// call stack -> function call -> setTimeout -> register callback ->
// task Queue-> add To CallStack -> Global
